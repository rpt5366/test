/**
 * A multithreaded chat room server. When a client connects, the server requests
 * a screen name by sending the client the text "SUBMITNAME", and keeps
 * requesting a name until a unique one is received. After a client submits a
 * unique name, the server acknowledges with "NAMEACCEPTED". Then all messages
 * from that client will be broadcast to all other clients that have submitted a
 * unique screen name. The broadcast messages are prefixed with "MESSAGE ".
 *
 * Because this is just a teaching example to illustrate a simple chat server,
 * there are a few features that have been left out. Two are very useful and
 * belong in production code:
 *
 * 1. The protocol should be enhanced so that the client can send clean
 * disconnect messages to the server.
 *
 * 2. The server should do some logging.
